Steamy Cup

For my final project I created a web application called Steamy Cup.

My idea came from the wine world can be overwhelming with all the many choices that it provides. There are hundreds of different varieties of wine and I am usually the one standing in the wine section unsure of what wine to choose.

Che Vino is designed to help the user discover new wines, read reviews, and check out wine scores. It helps take the guess work out of making that wine decision.

It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
